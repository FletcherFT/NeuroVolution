# Repository for NeuroVolution Concept
## Description
This workspace is for testing out the Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm with Non-Dominated Sorting Algorithm.
Current Version: 1
## ToDo List
### Version 1
- [x] Set up an agent (keras/tensorflow)
- [x] Set up a shearflow environment
- [x] Test multi-threading implementation of agent in shearflow (1950 s).
- [x] Test multi-processing implementation (640 s)
- [ ] Test multi-processing with threading implementation
- [x] NDSA
- [x] MOGA outer loop
- [x] Verbosity option on ZermeloSim.ZermeloSim._worker
- [x] Display results on MOGA_Zermelo.py
- [ ] Log results on MOGA_Zermelo.py

### Version 2
- [ ] Normalise shearflow environment.
- [ ] Check and correct energy and time costs.
- [ ] Potential bug: warnings about values of $$X_t$$ in ZermeloEnvironment

### Version 3
- [ ] Implement crowding distance operator.
- [ ] Larger Agent Size
- [ ] Experiment with RNN layers in agent (memory).
